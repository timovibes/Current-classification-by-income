# Current Classification by Income

This project is based on the **World Bankâ€™s classification of economies** by income group and region.  

I built it mainly as a way to **learn data visualization with Python**. Along the way, I practiced using **Pandas, Matplotlib, and Jupyter Notebook** to clean data, analyze it, and present the results in charts and reports.

## ðŸ“‚ Project Structure
- `data/` â†’ dataset files (World Bank classifications, etc.)
- `notebooks/` â†’ Jupyter Notebook with my analysis and visualizations
- `charts/` â†’ generated charts saved as PNG images
- `reports/` â†’ exported reports (e.g., PDF, PPTX)
- `README.md` â†’ this file

## ðŸ“Š What I Explored
- Number of economies per region
- Number of economies per income group
- Cross-tabulation of income groups across regions
- Visualizations saved as images and embedded in reports

## ðŸš€ How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/timovibes/Current-classification-by-income.git
   cd Current-classification-by-income
